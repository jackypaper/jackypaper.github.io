      <description>After watching two online courses on Coursera, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about Raspberry Pi into practice. Basically, those two courses which are taught by a professor from UC Irving cover a wide range of topics related with RPi and IoT stuff including web connection, usage of GPIO, camera module, application examples like blink.py and send_receive_twitter.py and so on.
So the prototype is a motion surveillance app with multiple alert action functions, which will be my capstone project for current stage of RPi learning.</description>
